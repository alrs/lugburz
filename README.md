# Lugbúrz

> Barad-dûr, the “Dark Tower,” is a fictional place in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth writings and is described in The Lord 
of the Rings, The Silmarillion, and other works. It is an enormous fortress of the Dark Lord Sauron, whence he rules the 
volcanic and barren land of Mordor. Located in northwest Mordor, near Mount Doom, the Eye of Sauron keeps watch over 
Middle-earth from its highest tower. The name is pronounced "Ba'rad doorr" with emphasis placed on the "rr."
The Lieutenant of Barad-dûr is the Mouth of Sauron, who acts as an ambassador and herald for Mordor and Sauron.
Barad-dûr was called "Lugbúrz" in the Black Speech of Mordor, which also translates as "Dark Tower"; it is composed of
Lug = Tower and Búrz = Dark.
